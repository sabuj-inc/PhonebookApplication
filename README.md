# 📞 PhonebookApplication (Java Console Project)

The **PhonebookApplication** is a simple console-based project written in Java. It allows users to manage contacts by performing essential operations such as adding, updating, deleting, searching, and sorting using core Java concepts like **OOP**, **ArrayLists**, **binary search**, and **merge sort**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new contacts
- 📋 View all saved contacts
- ✏️ Update contact information
- ❌ Delete contacts by name
- 🔍 Search contact using **Binary Search**
- 🔃 Sort contacts by **Add Date** (Descending) using **Merge Sort**
- 👋 Exit the application gracefully

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8+)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Algorithms (Binary Search, Merge Sort)
- Console I/O

---

A **console-based contact management system** built with **Java**, demonstrating object-oriented programming, real-time input handling, and algorithmic operations such as **binary search** and **merge sort**.

---

## 📖 1.1 Overview

The **Phonebook Application** is a Java console project that provides core contact management functionalities such as adding, updating, deleting, and searching contacts. The system uses object-oriented programming principles and demonstrates data manipulation techniques like **binary search**, **merge sort**, and **list management**. It simulates the operations of a digital phonebook and offers practical experience in Java-based system development.

---

## 💡 1.2 Motivation

In the age of smartphones and digital communication, contact management is fundamental. This project bridges the gap between theoretical Java knowledge and practical application. It reinforces key concepts like:

- Class design  
- Encapsulation  
- ArrayList manipulation  
- Algorithm implementation in a structured, interactive environment

## 🧩 1.3 Problem Definition

### 📌 1.3.1 Problem Statement

Manual contact management is inefficient and error-prone. Most beginner Java tutorials emphasize syntax but neglect real-world system building. This project fills that gap by enabling:

- Real-time data operations  
- Algorithmic sorting and searching  
- Hands-on object-oriented design

### 🔍 1.3.2 Complex Engineering Problem

This application addresses key challenges in software development:

- Designing and managing **dynamic object collections**
- Implementing efficient searching using **binary search**
- Performing **merge sort** based on contact metadata
- Maintaining a **text-based user interface**
- Handling **user input and exceptions** robustly

---

## 🎯 1.4 Design Goals / Objectives

The goal is to build a **modular, maintainable**, and **efficient** phonebook system that:

- Supports **real-time console interaction**
- Provides all **CRUD operations**
- Demonstrates **search and sort** algorithms
- Applies **OOP principles** like encapsulation and abstraction
- Handles edge cases: empty input, invalid data, duplicates, etc.

### 📋 1.4.1 Functionalities

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 👀 View Contacts | Display all saved contact entries |
| ➕ Add Contact | Add new contacts with name and phone number |
| ✏️ Update Contact | Modify existing contact information |
| ❌ Delete Contact | Remove contact by name |
| 🔎 Search Contact | Use **binary search** to find contacts |
| 🔽 Sort Contacts | Sort by **add date** using **merge sort** |
| 🚪 Exit | Cleanly terminate the program |

---

## 🎓 1.5 Application

### 📘 1.5.1 Educational Use Cases

- Learn and apply **Java OOP** fundamentals  
- Understand and implement **binary search** and **merge sort**  
- Practice managing dynamic data structures (`ArrayList`)  
- Reinforce concepts like **modular design** and **method abstraction**

### 💼 1.5.2 Relevance & Industry Demand

- 🔧 **Data Management Apps**: Similar logic used in CRM tools & syncing platforms  
- 🧠 **Algorithm Design**: Mastery of core search/sort algorithms  
- 🌐 **Backend Dev Foundation**: Mimics REST-like CRUD logic in a console environment  
- 💼 **Career Utility**: Helps software developers, QA engineers, and backend testers

---

## 🏁 1.6 Conclusion

The **Phonebook Application** is a compact yet powerful Java project that simulates real-world system development. It covers **OOP**, **algorithm implementation**, and **user interaction**, making it ideal for students, beginners, and enthusiasts.

This project lays the foundation for more advanced systems like:

- GUI-based apps (Swing/JavaFX)  
- Persistent storage with files or databases  
- Android-based contact managers
